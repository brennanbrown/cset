<h2 id="1-purpose">1. Purpose</h2>
<p>A primary goal of <strong>Calgary Society for Equity in Technology</strong> is to be inclusive to the largest number
    of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a
    friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity,
    socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).
</p>
<p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the
    consequences for unacceptable behaviour. We invite all those who participate in Calgary Society for Equity to help
    us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

<h2 id="2-open-source-culture-tech-citizenship">2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship</h2>
<p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open <strong>[source/culture/tech]</strong> citizenship by
